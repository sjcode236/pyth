What is pip
pip is a package manager for the Python programming language. It provides access to a massive repository of 
open source tools and libraries, as well as the ability to manage your own proprietary packages. One of the greatest 
benefits to using a package manager is that it automatically installs the dependencies of any package you install, 
allowing you to more quickly get back to writing some code.

===Installing pip 
pip is already installed if you are using Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 downloaded from python.org

# yum -y groupinstall development
# yum -y install zlib-devel
To install Python 3.6, run the following steps:
# wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.3/Python-3.6.3.tar.xz
# tar xJf Python-3.6.3.tar.xz

# Start by making sure your system is up-to-date:
yum update
# Compilers and related tools:
yum groupinstall -y "development tools"  or yum groupinstall -y development
# Libraries needed during compilation to enable all features of Python:
yum install -y zlib-devel openssl-devel sliteq-devel bzip2-devel
yum install -y zlib-devel bzip2-devel openssl-devel ncurses-devel sqlite-devel readline-devel tk-devel gdbm-devel db4-devel libpcap-devel xz-devel expat-devel
# If you are on a clean "minimal" install of CentOS you also need the wget tool:
yum install -y wget
