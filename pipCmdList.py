What is pip
pip is a package manager for the Python programming language. It provides access to a massive repository of 
open source tools and libraries, as well as the ability to manage your own proprietary packages. One of the greatest 
benefits to using a package manager is that it automatically installs the dependencies of any package you install, 
allowing you to more quickly get back to writing some code.
